				<div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Following up on <a href=\"http://na.lolesports.com/articles/lolesports-fantasy-league\">our draft</a>, we now bring you the results of Week 10 in the Lolesports Fantasy League. Only one week remains as we have a 4-way tie in third place while the Code Monkeys trail Gustaf's Gentlemen by just a game for first place. Read more to learn out about each owner's thoughts.</p> <p>Full standings can be found <a href=\"http://lolesports.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_scale/public/Week-10-Matchup-Record.jpg?itok=lLO_wZSa\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p> <h3>The Results</h3> <p><strong>Match 1</strong></p> <p><span class=\"image-container\">{1}</span></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jaugustine\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Augustine</a> - Yordle Ascension (5-5)</strong></p> <p>269.61 is my new favorite number. Link was my only weak link this week, and everyone else did so well that it didn't even matter. He could've turned into a gourd and rolled off the stage and I still would've won.</p> <p>Alliance and Fnatic are peaking at the perfect time -- just like last split. This is exactly why I picked them: they show up strong when it matters. I'm a little further behind than I'd hoped to be at this point, which means first place is out of reach. I could still end up in third, though. Bronze is still respectable, right?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/AlphaFerg\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson Mitchell</a> - FergSquad (5-5)</strong></p> <p>So close, yet so far. A loss last week puts us out of reach of first or second place, and worse, leaves us tied for third with four other teams. We need a win this week, we need a winning record. Can LMQ rebound to bring the FergSquad to victory? Can I salvage a horrible opening to my season and end with a winning record? Will Crumbzz become my best friend and savior of the season? I'll be waiting with baited breath, counting down the creeps until the end of the season. Vasilii, take me home.</p> <p><strong>Match 2</strong></p> <p><span class=\"image-container\">{1}</span></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/gentlemangustaf\" target=\"_blank\">Mattias Lehman</a> - Gustaf's Gentlemen (8-2)</strong></p> <p>The banter between the Gentlemen and the Unicorns finally came to a head, as this week I took them down and drank their blood for immortality. Those accursed Code Monkeys are still nipping at my heels, and our race to the end of the season is going to be intense, but at this point I can at least say that I fought with honor, and that I have no regrets. Only the gods - from their lofty Olympian perch - can judge me now, and I can only hope they deem me worthy of the ultimate title: The Champion of Lolesports Fantasy.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Glyceroll\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Whitmore</a> - Rainbow Unicorns (5-5)</strong></p> <p>I've officially thrown in the towel. Not only was this week terrible for my team, it was the single worst point total in the entire league since the beginning. Now, with my entire core of CLG moving to Korea for a week, I'm left high and dry with no chance of breaking into the top two. It pains me to replace Doublelift with Chaox... it hurts my very soul. I made the best of a bad situation by swapping out what I could of my CLG players and swapping CLG for Curse with my team selection. Curse has been doing better each week so hopefully it's a good change. I need a bit of good news this week as the Sparkle Unicorns have lost a lot of their shimmer.</p> <p><strong>Match 3</strong></p> <p><span class=\"image-container\">{1}</span></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/NeoIllusions\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Ho</a> - Dragonslayer Teemo (5-5)</strong></p> <p>Another week decided by the closest of margins but luckily this time I was on the winning side. While Tabzz and Kev1n both put up a strong performance last week, SK scared me as they finished 1-1 last week. However, even in their loss, SK managed to put up a decent numbers across the board. Now, I'm up against none other than Rainbow Unicorns. With Gustaf far ahead of me in the standings, I'll take a minor victory as long as I don't finish the season behind Glyceroll.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Trent_Esports\" target=\"_blank\">Trent Murray</a> - This is My Smurf (2-8)</strong></p> <p>Argh! 2 points away! If I had played literally anyone else Top lane I would have won. Time to finally give up on Seraph ever turning it around and pray Xaxus does something this week. On the plus side, Cloud9 have picked things up considerably. I would be very interested to see how my season would have gone if I had a different Top laner and not waited so long to swap Impaler into the jungle.</p> <p><strong>Match 4</strong></p> <p><span class=\"image-container\">{1}</span></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ThomasHWatts\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Watts</a> - Code Monkeys (7-3)</strong></p> <p>Monkey brethren, we are on the precipice of victory following a win over Diana Fire. The Head Monkey added coffee cake to the ritual of Fritos and Mountain Dew to celebrate that win. It has put the Monkeys within one game of first. First place Gustaf's Gentleman plays against Yordle Ascension, who owns the Rekkles/YellOwSTaR tandem that has been destroying everything in their path for weeks now. The Monkeys beat the Gentlemen earlier in the season, but the specifics of the tiebreaker are unclear should we end the season tied. On the team front, the Monkeys had to play Jree since Gleeb lost his position, and your Head Monkey couldn't grab Lustboy quickly enough. That created an EU bias so the Head Monkey made an eleventh hour decision to bench Jankos in favor of Helios going into crucial Week 11.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/karonmoser\" target=\"_blank\">Kelsey Moser</a> - Diana Fire (3-7)</strong></p> <p>My pride put xPeke in for the ultimate Alliance vs Fnatic matchup. I bit off more than I could chew, especially since the Copenhagen Wolves had the gall to not ban Kassadin against Froggen. It can't be helped.</p> <p>As for my North American players, I believe there's a quote about failure that isn't meant to be inspirational written by someone. I would leave it here, as I have nothing of value to say.</p> </div></div>
